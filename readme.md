The One Ring Theme for Roll20
-----------------------------

Roll20, the web-based online virtual tabletop system is fantastic for many things, however being atmospheric and nice to look at is not one of those, I'm afraid. So I made this somewhat Fantasy Grounds inspired look for use with The One Ring in particular (easily modified for other games, simply by removing the ring and the ring poem graphics).
