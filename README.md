# Notes

This is implemented in the most hacky, yet simple way possible; by
overwriting Roll20's CSS with my own. It's liable to break at any time.

It also only does fairly basic things, just to make Roll20 aslightly
more atmospheric place to spend 4-6 hours slaughtering innocent slimy
monsters and hauling their treasures back to civilization.

The graphics used were created by me from free image resources and icon
packs found online, and are yours to use in exchange for attribution.
